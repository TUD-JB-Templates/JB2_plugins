# hello

## Notes (written in the editor):

\- the iframe still needs to be passed the file location\
\- the iframe does not replace all elements. this should be the case. this can be fixed using a plugin\
\- a lot of jb2 features (i think most things using :::{element}:::) are not supported. needs more testing.\
\- database does not work - if things go wrong \*\*Go to f12 > application > Storage > IndexedDB > test\_database > ‘Delete database’\
\*\*- iframe shows itself to be edited, in the codeblock at the bottom of the page. Ideally we want to hide this part. (could be done in /app > parser > index.tsx > code which removes element so its not displayed. needs to be added back later to be committed to gh)
